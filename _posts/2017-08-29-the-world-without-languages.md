### Could you imagine how would it be like if we did not have languages?

...

I'm pretty sure you can find a lot of research papers about the effects
of languages on the Internet. Just try googling it. However, this question
has come to my mind years ago when I read a book which now I don't
remember the name (it's from *a day* publisher). But instead of
telling you the content of the book (which I also barely remember),
I would like to demonstrate the experience of losing languages to you
so you can see what would happen.

Imagine that while you're reading this post, you suddenly
lost all of the abilities about languages. Hmm, maybe that's
too difficult. Let's start over with reading then. You suddenly
lost the ability of reading, so these texts would be like random
characters for you and you have no idea what they mean. You might
have thought "Why can't I read these text?". You were shocked and
want to text someone about this trouble. Just before you
started typing, you realized that you couldn't compose a word
because you have no clue what these characters are. You
could not even draw a word in your head. And If you think this totally sucks,
suddenly, you lost all of the abilities of languages. Now, this is the
real deal. Can you see? You could not think "What happened?"
or "What am I going to do now?" or even an F-word because you *didn't know*
any of those sentences, words or characters. Actually, you could not think
of anything that is based on languages, which is the fundamental
of almost anything in your brain. So in conclusion, *you could not think!*

At this point, someone may object to the above conclusion. There must
be something we can think of without languages, right!? Yes, There are.
You can still think of feelings like hot, cold, hungry, angry and so on.
And you also can imagine things as pictures in your head.
But can you see what's missing here? There is no longer *rational
thinking*. And that would bring humanity into a dark age, an age that
humans are just another kind of monkeys.

So, this brings us two important questions. First, how could we
create a language at the first place? It must have been incredibly
difficult back in the day that humans had no languages at all.
Can you imagine the difficulty of creating a word from nothing?
Second, Are we stuck in our own languages? As the success of
modern languages, are we stopping developing more effective languages?
And if you ask "Is there any other language that is more effective than
the current ones?". Honestly, I don't know. But have you ever experience
a phenomenon where your intuition is more accurate and faster than your
thought? Or sometimes that you feel like the language itself is slowing
you down from thinking. I think the answer to the first question will
open up the door for creating the new and more effective language.
But creating a better language may be even harder than creating a language
from nothing.

Before I finish this post, I have a little advice for you who are
finishing reading this. If getting rid of the language eliminates
the rational thinking, so what is the opposite side of that process?
The answer is learning new languages. In other words, you
will have better rational thinking from learning other different
languages. And I didn't mean just the languages for speaking. Nobody
is going to stop you from learning a sign language, body language,
or even a programming language (I really recommend the last one).

So, that's it. What do you think?
